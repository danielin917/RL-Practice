# Deep Reinforcement Learning: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications

Welcome to my personal repository for learning and exploring Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL)! This repository documents my journey as I work through a course curriculum based on resources from [Spinning Up in Deep RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html) and Berkeley's [Deep RL Course](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/). All code, notes, and projects here are for my own study, experimentation, and research exploration.
